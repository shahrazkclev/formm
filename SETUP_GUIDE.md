  }
]
```

### Step 3: Deploy Cloudflare Worker

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

2. Login to Cloudflare:
```bash
wrangler login
```

3. Update `wrangler.toml` with your details:
```toml
name = "video-anywhere-worker"
main = "cloudflare-worker.js"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "VIDEO_BUCKET"
bucket_name = "your-actual-bucket-name"
preview_bucket_name = "your-actual-bucket-name-preview"

[vars]
ACCOUNT_ID = "your-cloudflare-account-id"
```

4. Deploy the worker:
```bash
wrangler deploy
```

### Step 4: Get Your Worker URL

- Ensure file is a valid video format
- Verify Worker has proper R2 bucket permissions

### Code not working on website?
